# What is objected-oriented programming (OOP)?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that has the concept of "objects", which can contain data and methods that are related, to make code maintainable and reusable.  

Before OOP came out, procedural programming was popular which is based on the concept of "procedure call" and takes a top-down approach. However, if the system becomes complicated, it will be difficult to grasp and maintain the code.  

## There are 4 main features in OOP  

### 1. Encapsulation
&emsp;Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods within a unit to restrict direct access to the information. It is used to hide details from the outside, preventing unexpected data manipulation.  
&emsp;It is common to make the data private and use getter and setter methods to access the data indirectly.  

### 2. Polymorphism
&emsp;Polymorphism is the concept that provides multiple forms from single method to objects (overriding) or allows same name of methods using different parameters (overloading).  


### 3. Inheritance
&emsp;Inheritance is the concept that derives a class (derived/child/sub class) from another class (base/parent/super class), inheriting fields and methods. Derived class is able to use these and also make its own fields and methods.  

### 4. Abstraction
&emsp;Abstraction is the concept of hiding unnecessary implementation details while showing essential information.
